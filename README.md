Out of linear regression,decision tree, random forest and Neural networks, Root Mean square error is less for Neural networks.
As we have seen there is a high correlation between 2 variable, pca has also reduced one component. We have observed it while doing the grid search cross validation.
### Results of neural networks.
 As we have 4 ioutput variable and its range varies differently, I have found mean square error across each output. Otherwise one will affect other alot and we won't get a clear picture of results
